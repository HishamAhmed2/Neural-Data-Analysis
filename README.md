# Neural-Data-Analysis
This repository contains 5 projects about the analysis of different types neural data such as electrophysiology, EEG, fMRI, Ca imaging and a simulation of AdEx biophysical model of neuron. These projects were done as part of "Essentials of Neuroscience with Matlab" online course. The main language used in course is matlab however, I have done projects in python because I dont have an access to a matlab license currently.
## Spike Analysis Project
<br/> Analysis of electrophysiological data from visual cortex of a monkey (stimuli consist of sinusoidal gratings at 12 orientations spaced equally)
<br/> **Data**: Kohn, A., Smith, M.A. (2016) Utah array extracellular recordings of spontaneous and visually evoked activity from anesthetized macaque primary visual cortex (V1). CRCNS.org http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K0NC5Z4X
<br/> **Publication**: Smith, Matthew A., and Adam Kohn. "Spatial and temporal scales of neuronal correlation in primary visual cortex." Journal of Neuroscience 28.48 (2008): 12591-12603
## EEG Analysis Project
<br/> Analysis of EEG data in steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) task 
<br/> **Publication**: Mora-Cortes, A.; Ridderinkhof, KR; Cohen, MX. (2018) Evaluating the feasibility of the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) to study temporal attention. Psychophysiology
## AdEx Model 
<br/> Simulation of Adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model (AdEx) of neuron. The Adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model, also called AdEx, is a spiking neuron model with two variables. The first equation describes the dynamics of the membrane potential and includes an activation term with an exponential voltage dependence. Voltage is coupled to a second equation which describes adaptation.
